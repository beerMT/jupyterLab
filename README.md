## hunt1
This example takes an http bro log and uses python to do frequency analysis (i.e. long tail, stacking, most/least frequent occurence) on the HTTP fields. Presented in this example is an adversarially focused hypothesis to investigate the data.

## hunt2
This example uses the same http bro log and uses python to do visualization and graphing of the data. Presented in this example is a data centric hypothesis to investigate the data.
